# CS-330-OpenGL

How do I approach designing software?
**When working on these projects, I completely read all of the instructions and rubric to get a high level view of the project. I then break it down into manaageable parts and work on each item.**

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
**In this course I have learned about lighting using the Phone Reflection Model. Using the three types of lighting, the picture becomes more poslished and realistic.**

What design process did you follow for your project work?
**I used the incremental design process building this project starting with the basics and adding/improving over time.**

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
**When working on future projects, it is always important to be able to work on smaller parts of a bigger project. Being able to break a task down into smaller parts is an essential skill in developemnt.**

How do I approach developing programs?
**Spend time to understand how a project is set up and working to incrementally improve over time by working on small parts.**

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
**I spent time learning about each change in the program before implementing the changes. I have also learned to make small changes to better understand how parts of the program worked.**

How did iteration factor into your development?
**In this project, every module was an iteration building up the 3d scene and improving it over time.**

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
**The iterative design process has guided me through the basics and on to more complex concepts building my skills as the course progressed. This allowed me to understand each concept as I was learning.**

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
**Computer science is unlocking the power of the computer. It should help me find a more appealing job and I can use a lot of the skills I am learning on my own projects. I am currently already working on a video game**

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
**I am taking a few game development courses and this course has helped me understand graphics more. I am now interested in graphics more than I was because I never considered myself an artist.**

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
**Having gained some knowledge about OpenGL, I could be a resource for future project with a future employer. Having a broad range of skills makes me more marketable.**
